# Text Paginator

A basic interface to take one message and break it into chunks small enough to send by SMS. Served as an offline-first progressive web app.

Built around the core use case of transmitting long messages over the [Garmin InReach](https://discover.garmin.com/en-US/inreach/personal/)'s text messaging service, while far away from cell towers.

Hosted [here](https://mileswwatkins.github.io/text-paginator/) on GitHub Pages.
